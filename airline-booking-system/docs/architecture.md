# Airline Booking System - Architecture & Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture and design decisions for a comprehensive, enterprise-grade airline booking system. The system integrates with Amadeus APIs to provide real-time flight search, booking, and management capabilities while maintaining high performance, security, and scalability standards.

## Technology Stack Selection

### Frontend Architecture
**Next.js 14 with React 18** has been selected as the optimal frontend framework for the following reasons:

- **SEO Optimization**: Next.js provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities, crucial for search engine visibility in the competitive airline industry
- **Performance**: Built-in optimization features including automatic code splitting, image optimization, and prefetching
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support, hot reloading, and comprehensive tooling
- **Scalability**: Edge runtime support and API routes for hybrid applications

### Backend Architecture
**Node.js with Express.js** has been chosen over Django REST Framework for optimal performance:

- **JavaScript Ecosystem**: Unified language across frontend and backend reduces complexity
- **Performance**: V8 engine provides excellent performance for I/O intensive operations typical in booking systems
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Native WebSocket support for real-time flight updates
- **Amadeus SDK**: Official Node.js SDK available for seamless API integration

### Database Strategy
**MongoDB with Mongoose ODM** selected for the following advantages:

- **Flexible Schema**: Airline data structures vary significantly between carriers and routes
- **JSON-Native**: Seamless integration with JavaScript ecosystem
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Built-in sharding capabilities for global deployment
- **Performance**: Optimized for read-heavy workloads typical in flight search

### Authentication & Security
**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** with refresh token strategy:

- **Stateless**: Enables horizontal scaling without session storage
- **Cross-Domain**: Supports multiple subdomain deployments
- **Mobile-Ready**: Native support for mobile applications
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Flexible permission system for users and administrators

## System Architecture Overview

### High-Level Architecture

The system follows a microservices-inspired architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

│   (Next.js)     │◄──►│   (Express.js)  │◄──►│   (Amadeus)     │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                │
                                ▼
                       ┌─────────────────┐
                       │   Database      │
                       │   (MongoDB)     │
                       └─────────────────┘
```

#### Database Schema Design

**Users Collection**:
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  email: String (unique, indexed),
  password: String (hashed),
  profile: {
    firstName: String,
    lastName: String,
    phone: String,
    dateOfBirth: Date,
    nationality: String
  },
  role: String (enum: 'user', 'admin'),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  isActive: Boolean
}
```

**Bookings Collection**:
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  pnr: String (unique, indexed),
  userId: ObjectId (ref: Users),
  flightDetails: {
    outbound: FlightSegment,
    return: FlightSegment (optional),
    passengers: [PassengerDetails],
    totalPrice: Number,
    currency: String
  },
  status: String (enum: 'pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled', 'completed'),
  paymentStatus: String,
  amadeusOrderId: String,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  metadata: Object
}
```

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Architecture
The API follows REST principles with clear resource-based URLs:

- `GET /api/flights/search` - Search available flights
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create new booking
- `GET /api/bookings/:pnr` - Retrieve booking by PNR
- `PUT /api/bookings/:pnr` - Update booking status
- `DELETE /api/bookings/:pnr` - Cancel booking

### Error Handling Strategy
Consistent error response format across all endpoints:

```javascript
{
  "error": {
    "code": "FLIGHT_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested flight is no longer available",
    "details": {
      "flightNumber": "AA1234",
      "date": "2024-01-15"
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-01-10T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Rate Limiting
Implemented at multiple levels:
- **Global**: 1000 requests per hour per IP
- **User**: 100 requests per minute per authenticated user
- **Search**: 10 flight searches per minute per user
- **Booking**: 5 booking attempts per hour per user

## Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. **Registration**: Email verification with secure password requirements
2. **Login**: JWT token generation with refresh token strategy
3. **Authorization**: Role-based middleware for protected routes
4. **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh and secure logout

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest using AES-256
- **HTTPS**: TLS 1.3 enforcement for all communications
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Joi schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input sanitization
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and input encoding

### PCI Compliance
